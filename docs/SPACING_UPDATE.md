# ✅ Dashboard Spacing Updated

I've increased the vertical space between the main dashboard content and the AI widgets.

### 📐 Changes
- Added `mt-8` (32px top margin) to the **Personalized Quote** section.
- This creates a clear visual break between your tracking data (Habits/Goals) and the AI inspiration tools.

The layout should now feel much more balanced! 🧘
