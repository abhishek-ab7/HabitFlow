# ✅ Dashboard Layout Updated

I've successfully rearranged the dashboard widgets based on your request.

### 🖼️ New Layout Structure

1. **Hero Section** (Top)
2. **Metric Cards** (Streaks, stats)
3. **Today's Tasks**
4. **Recent Activity** & **Focus Goals** (Side-by-side grid)
5. **AI Widgets** (Moved here 👇)
   - Personalized Quote
   - AI Coach
6. **Quick Actions** (Bottom)

### 🧹 Changes Made
- Moved `PersonalizedQuote` and `AICoachWidget` components in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Positioned them immediately after the main content grid
- Maintained consistent spacing and responsiveness

The dashboard should now feel less cluttered at the top, putting your core data first! 🚀
